#Introduction

I will presume that you know nothing about programming so lets start from the start.
 
##What is Programming

 In the most basic sense, programming means creating a set of instructions for completing some specific task. If you think about it its like doing daily task such as boiling an egg, if you were to write down on paper how to do this it might look something like the following.

 1. get a saucepan
 2. half fill the saucepan with cold water from the tap
 3. get an egg
 4. place the egg in the water in the saucepan 
 5. place the saucepan that contains the egg and the water on the cooker ring
 6. turn on cooker ring
 7. boil for 3 minutes
 8. takle off cooker ring after 3 minutes of boiling
 9. crack the top of the egg with a spoon or knife
 10. eat the egg

 Okay I'm not great in the kitchen and you might see some faults in my instructions but you get the idea, programming is similiar to this.
