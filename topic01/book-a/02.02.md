##Types of Languages

There are so many [programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) to mention here but the main idea is to remember that all languages have rules i.e. the way you might say or write something. For the purpose of these labs we will use [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) as the programming language.


##Uses of Languages

There are many uses for programming languages, Java is a multi disipline language which means it can be used to do a lot of different tasks, Python is another Laguage that is similair, PHP is used in web development, Swift is used Mobile development etc.

**Note:** just a quick point about Java, it also a platform as well as an programming language, which means that Java comes with a development environment as well as the capability to write, compile and run java programs.
