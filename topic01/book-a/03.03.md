#Programming Concepts

Every programming language have certain concepts in common, all programming langaues use variables to store data, all programming languages have control concepts, they all use data structures, they all use functions or sub-sections to do specfic tasks and they are developed using certain tools.

##Varables

In most applications we weill need to include vaiables in out program's. [Varables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29) are our way of storeing data in our programs.

In java every variable has a certain Type which means that we can only store certain types of data in that varaible, so if we create a interger variable we can only store whole numbers in that variable i.e. 100 or 2345 or 4

##Control Concepts

If we have some value in a variable and we want to test what value is stored in the variable we could use [control structures](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html) such an IF statment or we might want to do the same task over and over again so we might use a loop, so basically control structure decide on the program flow .i. which direction the program goes, where does it go next?

##Data Structures

If you can imagine if we work for a large organization like Google and we have 10,000 emepleyee, it would be impractical to delare 10,000 variables, so what we need to do is create a [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) like an array or collection, these allow use to collect and store data of the same type all in the one place

##Functions or Sub-Sections

In java we call these [methods](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html) Methods allow us to do a certain task such as changing the contents of a variable or displaying the contents of a variable
