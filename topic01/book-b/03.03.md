##The Complile process

When we write and run programs in java we must go through the [compile progrss.](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/compile-136656.html) When we write java program (lets say the HellowWorld.java) we create a file with the .java extension, through our IDE we complie this program but behind the scences the JDK will create another file called a class file which contains bytecode, we then run this bytecode through the Java Virtual Machine (the Java VM) which gives us out output or result, see image below.
